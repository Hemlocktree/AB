# Schools in Edmonton

Concering both Public and Catholic schools in Edmonton:

* [CBC: Edmonton school divisions take steps to upgrade ventilation as students return](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-school-divisions-take-steps-to-upgrade-ventilation-as-students-return-1.6308140) - Jan 2022, CBC talks about ventilation work for 
* [Edmonton school divisions take steps to upgrade ventilation as students return](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/edmonton-school-divisions-steps-upgrade-001800745.html) - Jan 2022

## Public Schools

All classrooms have mechanical ventilation, most with MERV13. All classrooms (and rooms like libraries) have HEPA standalone units. None have PM2.5 or Co2 monitoring, as yet. We are not sure about classroom density but since almost all schools are over capacity, it is likely high.

**In the media**

* [CDC, Edmonton, opinion: Fighting for air filters in schools showed me why we need an unfiltered public health office](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/opinion-alberta-election-my-priority-independent-public-health-officer-1.6832128) 0 May 2023

* [GlobalNews.ca: Edmonton Public Schools to spend $6M on HEPA filters for classrooms](https://globalnews.ca/news/8624348/edmonton-public-schools-6-million-hepa-filters/) - Feb 2022

The above is a comparison of EPSB and the Calgary School Board. EPSB recieved HEPAs air-filtration and CSB did not. Otherwise they are quite similar districts, so we use them to show the difference that HEPAs makes in illness rates. When the lines converge on that chart its often because Calgary had days off that Edmonton did not. In those graphs you can always see a decline in illness rates following school days off.

## Catholic Schools

There has been similar work done for Catholic schools in Edmonton, and we're trying to find out details to post here. The filters purchased are MERV13 instead of HEPA, [as described here](https://www.ecsd.net/strengthening-ventilation-in-schools)
